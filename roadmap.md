# Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap tracks the implementation of the **hybrid architecture** migration from a monolithic Flask + Jinja template app to a modern React frontend with Flask API backend.

## Architecture Vision

**Target State:**
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + Chakra UI
- **Backend**: Flask REST API
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0 with session-based auth
- **Migration Strategy**: Gradual feature migration, maintaining backward compatibility

**Key Principles:**
1. Same-domain deployment to avoid CORS complexity
2. Session-based auth with httpOnly cookies
3. Progressive migration of features from Jinja to React
4. Maintain legacy routes during transition period

## Technical Decisions

### Authentication
- **Choice**: Session-based auth with httpOnly cookies
- **Rationale**: Simple, secure, works seamlessly with same-domain deployment
- **Alternative Considered**: JWT tokens (added complexity for refresh)

### Frontend Framework
- **Choice**: React + Vite + TypeScript
- **Rationale**: Fast dev experience, strong typing, modern tooling
- **Alternative Considered**: Vue, Svelte (team familiarity favored React)

### UI Library
- **Choice**: Chakra UI
- **Rationale**: Lightweight, good theming, accessible components
- **Alternative Considered**: Material-UI (heavier), Tailwind (more manual)

### API Client
- **Choice**: Axios with withCredentials
- **Rationale**: Automatic cookie handling, good error handling
- **Alternative Considered**: Fetch API (requires more boilerplate)

### Deployment Strategy
- **Choice**: Same-domain deployment (Flask serves React build)
- **Rationale**: Avoids CORS, simpler configuration, cookie handling
- **Alternative Considered**: Separate deployments (more complex)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: OAuth redirect_uri mismatch
- **Mitigation**: Maintain comprehensive env var documentation
- **Fallback**: Keep legacy login available during transition

### Risk: Session cookie issues in production
- **Mitigation**: Test cookie settings early in staging
- **Fallback**: Implement JWT fallback if needed

### Risk: Name Generator API not ready
- **Mitigation**: Keep Jinja version available until API stable
- **Timeline**: Only migrate after thorough testing

### Risk: Rate limiting causes false positives
- **Mitigation**: Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- **Monitoring**: Track rate limit hits in logs

### Risk: OAuth clock skew
- **Mitigation**: Ensure server time synchronization
- **Configuration**: Allow configurable clock_skew parameter
